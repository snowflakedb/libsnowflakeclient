.SH NAME
chfn \- change your finger information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chfn
.RB [ \-f
.IR full-name ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR office ]
.RB [ \-p
.IR office-phone ]
.RB [ \-h
.IR home-phone ]
.RB [ \-u ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chfn
is used to change your finger information.  This information is
stored in the
.I /etc/passwd
file, and is displayed by the
.B finger
program.  The Linux
.B finger
command will display four pieces of information that can be changed by
.BR chfn :
your real name, your work room and phone, and your home phone.
.PP
Any of the four pieces of information can be specified on the command
line.  If no information is given on the command line,
.B chfn
enters interactive mode.
.PP
In interactive mode,
.B chfn
will prompt for each field.  At a prompt, you can enter the new information,
or just press return to leave the field unchanged.  Enter the keyword
"none" to make the field blank.
.PP
.B chfn
supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.\&) if linked with libuser,
otherwise use \fBypchfn\fR, \fBlchfn\fR or any other implementation for
non-local entries.

.SH CONFIG FILE ITEMS
.B chfn
reads the
.IR /etc\:/login.defs (5)
configuration file.  Note that the configuration file could be
distributed with another package (e.g., shadow-utils).  The following
configuration items are relevant for
.BR chfn (1):
.PP
.BI CHFN_RESTRICT " string"
.RS 4
Indicate which fields are changeable by \fBchfn\fR.

The boolean setting \fB"yes"\fR means that only the Office, Office Phone and
Home Phone fields are changeable, and boolean setting \fB"no"\fR means that
also the Full Name is changeable.

Another way to specify changeable fields is by abbreviations: f = Full Name,
r = Office (room), w = Office (work) Phone, h = Home Phone.  For example,
\fBCHFN_RESTRICT "wh"\fR allows changing work and home phone numbers.

If CHFN_RESTRICT is undefined, then all finger information is read-only.
This is the default.
