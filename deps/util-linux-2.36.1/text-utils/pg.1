.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pg
.RB [ \-\fIamount\fP ]
.RB [ \-p
.IR prompt ]
.RB [ \-cefnrs ]
.RB [ +\fIline\fP ]
.RB [ +/\fIpattern\fP/ ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pg
displays a text file on a
.SM CRT
one screenful at once.
After each page, a prompt is displayed.  The user may then either press the
newline key to view the next page or one of the keys described below.
.PP
If no filename is given on the command line,
.B pg
reads from standard input.
If standard output is not a terminal,
.B pg
acts like
.BR cat (1)
but precedes each file with its name if there is more than one.
.PP
If input comes from a pipe,
.B pg
stores the data in a buffer file while reading,
to make navigation possible.
.SH OPTIONS
.B pg
accepts the following options:
.TP
.BI + number
Start at the given line number.
.TP
.BI +/ pattern /
Start at the line containing the Basic Regular Expression
.I pattern
given.
.TP
.BI \- number
The number of lines per page.  By default, this is the number of

lines minus one.
.TP
.B \-c
Clear the screen before a page is displayed,
if the terminfo entry for the terminal provides this capability.
