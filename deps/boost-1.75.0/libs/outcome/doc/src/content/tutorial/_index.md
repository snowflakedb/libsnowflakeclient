This tutorial refers to Outcome v2.1, which is the current stable version.
In early 2021 it shall be refactored to refer to Outcome v2.2. Where
changes are particularly profound however, we have carved out special
mention of v2.2 facilities, but otherwise if targeting v2.2, you shall need
to apply [the v2.1 => v2.2 upgrade guide]({{% relref "/changelog/upgrade_v21_v22" %}}) to
the content in this tutorial.
