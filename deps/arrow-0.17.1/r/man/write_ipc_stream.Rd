\description{
Apache Arrow defines two formats for \href{https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#serialization-and-interprocess-communication-ipc}{serializing data for interprocess communication (IPC)}:
a "stream" format and a "file" format, known as Feather. \code{write_ipc_stream()}
and \code{\link[=write_feather]{write_feather()}} write those formats, respectively.
}
\details{
\code{write_arrow()}, a wrapper around \code{write_ipc_stream()} and \code{write_feather()}
with some nonstandard behavior, is deprecated. You should explicitly choose
the function that will write the desired IPC format (stream or file) since
either can be written to a file or \code{OutputStream}.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link[=write_feather]{write_feather()}} for writing IPC files. \code{\link[=write_to_raw]{write_to_raw()}} to
serialize data to a buffer.
\link{RecordBatchWriter} for a lower-level interface.
