# DataFusion

DataFusion is an in-memory query engine that uses Apache Arrow as the memory model. It supports executing SQL queries against CSV and Parquet files as well as querying directly against in-memory data.

## Using DataFusion as a library

DataFusion can be used as a library by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
datafusion = "0.17.1"
```

## Using DataFusion as a binary

DataFusion includes a simple command-line interactive SQL utility. See the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for more information.
