# substrait::{ExtensionTypeVariation, ExtensionType}s
# for wrapping types which appear in the arrow type system but
# are not first-class in substrait. These include:
# - null
# - unsigned integers
# - half-precision floating point numbers
# - 32-bit times and 64-bit dates
# - timestamps with units other than microseconds
# - timestamps with timezones other than UTC
# - 256-bit decimals
# - sparse and dense unions
# - dictionary encoded types
# - durations
# - string and binary with 64 bit offsets
# - list with 64-bit offsets
# - interval<months: i32>
# - interval<days: i32, millis: i32>
# - interval<months: i32, days: i32, nanos: i64>
# - arrow::ExtensionTypes
#
# Note that not all of these are currently implemented. In particular, these
# extension types are currently not parameterizable in Substrait, which means
# among other things that we can't declare dictionary type here at all since
# we'd have to declare a different dictionary type for all encoded types
# (but that is an infinite space). Similarly, we would have to declare a
# timestamp variation for all possible timezone strings.
