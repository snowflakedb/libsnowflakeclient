                          Litani Test Suite
                          =================

The `run` script uses litani to run a variety of unit and system tests.
The dashboard showing the output of the latest test run will always be
symlinked from test/output/latest/html/index.html.

# OPTIONS

*--output-dir*
	Litani will write all of its test output files for this run to this path

*--fast*
    Do not run tests with SLOW variable set to True

## Writing Tests

Each test is made up of 4 jobs: init, add-jobs, run-build, and check-run
If --fast flag is passed, each job is given a timeout of 10 seconds.
In the worst case, a test would take 40 seconds to run.
For each test, SLOW is set to True if jobs fail to pass the above timeout.
