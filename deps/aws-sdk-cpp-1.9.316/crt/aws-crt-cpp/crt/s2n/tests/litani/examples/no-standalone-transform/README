Each of the run-*.sh scripts in this directory is a standalone Litani-based
build that runs two jobs: echo "foo" and echo something else.

If you wish to run a single build that contains all the jobs except those that
print foo, you can run run-all.py, which demonstrates how to use the *litani
transform-jobs* command. This shows how to modify the jobs to be run, without
needing to manually tweak the run-*.sh scripts.

To try this out, run

    LITANI=../../litani ./run-all.py

in this directory.
