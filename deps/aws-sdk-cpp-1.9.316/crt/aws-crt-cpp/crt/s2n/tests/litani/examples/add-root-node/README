The original-run.sh script runs four jobs---three in parallel, and then
a final job that depends on the three outputs.

If you cannot modify this script, but want to run a job that runs before
the first three, you can use *litani-transform-jobs(1)* as show in
run-all.py.

To try this out, run

    LITANI=../../litani ./run-all.py

in this directory.
