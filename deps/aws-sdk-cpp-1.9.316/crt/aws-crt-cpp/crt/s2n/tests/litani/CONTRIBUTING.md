Thank you for contributing to Litani! This document collects some coding and
process guidelines.


### HTML Dashboard

- Please test your changes with both light and dark mode, and with a range of
  browser widths.
- Almost all top-level divs should have an id attribute; this makes it easy to
  link to specific information.
- We prefer to inline all assets (CSS, images) onto the page so that it's easy
  to send single, self-contained pages around. For this reason, please try to
  keep SVGs small.
